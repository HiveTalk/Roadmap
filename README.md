# HiveTalk Roadmap

## Issues
If there are any additional issues that arise, please file an issue on this github repo.


## TODO List. 

#### 1st release

-   add nostr login - done
-   add nostr avatar picture, name - done
-   enable front page - show active public rooms - done
    - ( use built-in API to pull data to front page, see samples in codebase)
-   add link to nostr profile in the chat avatar.  Make this more visible on the dropdown (v2)

#### 2nd release

-   fix chatroom avatars so that nostr avatars are shown in chat. (see link to video below)
-   add 'Talking in room now' user post to nostr relays. (similar to twitter/X)
-   Add Zap functionality
-   is there a webRTC timeout?
-   fix any other bugs as needed

#### 3rd release

-   Remove items that aren't needed or might have issues like google translate or transcription.
-   add API keys for different users on request.
-   enable chatGPT or rather, bitcoiner equiv unleashed.chat
-   TODO items in the existing code base, and from upstream fork.
-   Clean up messy components in code base.
-   Release **Open Source** to Public on Stable.

### Additional Notes to Fix from Above: 

- see in video below, the nostr profile opens out to an external window. the link should be a more visible button, such as dropdown
- Also see chat avatars in chat are not matching the nostr logged in avatar. Random name avatars are OK.
